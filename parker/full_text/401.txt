                    character . 

                 At the beginning are five leaves of a thick woolly paper which seem a good deal
                    earlier than the rest. These are portions of larger leaves folded so that the
                    writing comes vertically. There is also another leaf of smaller size.
                         (ff.  viv - ir )  

                 The volume must have been acquired from an English source by
                         Parker : otherwise he would not have had written
                    on f.  1r  (as he has done):   Hic liber quondam
                    fuit  Theodori archiepiscopi Cantuariensis  (!!!). 

                  Professor E. G. Browne  has very kindly given me the
                    following note on the contents of the volume  (see contents
                        below)
