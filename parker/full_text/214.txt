                     ,  ff. 123 ,  originally 18 lines to a
                        page . The original size of the leaves must have been about 11 x 8.
                    The largest fragments now measure about 9 x 6. The top edge of some leaves
                    survives in part; the rest have been entirely eaten away by rats and much of the
                    text is gone. It has been in quires of eight leaves. The manuscript may be of
                    cent.  xi  (x-xi  Bradshaw ),
                         in two very clear hands . 



                 Given by  Daniel Rogers . 
                 To me the book has very much the
                    appearance of a  Canterbury  production. 
                 
                     The manuscript was rebound and the mutilated
                        leaves inlaid, in proper order, in  1911 .

                         Thirteen fragments of leaves belong to Liber I. There are
                            many gaps 
                         The first book has contemporary marginal and interlinear glosses in
                            Latin. The marginal glosses have Greek letters referring to their places
                            in the text. 
                         Liber II begins with f.  14r  and has no
                            gap 
                         The glosses continue into book II: at f.  25v  they
                            cease 
                         Liber III 
                         With the third book begins an Anglo-Saxon gloss
                                 in a very pretty and delicate hand :
                                 another coarser hand sometimes occurs . The
                            first words are 

                          Iam [eallinga] cantum [sang] illa [ƿeg] finiuerat
                            [geendude] ... [þaþ]

                         This gloss continues to f.  53r  (line 1) 
                         Throughout the book the order of words, especially in the poems, is
                            indicated by (Anglo-Saxon) letters written above the words: but very few
                            if any further glosses occur 
                         Liber IV

                         On this page are some later pencil notes
                                ( xiii? ) in which sums of money are mentioned: very
                            faint 
                         On f.  123v  besides scribbles and probationes pennae is
                            the name  Rodbertus  ( xi,
                            xii )
