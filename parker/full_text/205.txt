                        202 ,  36 lines to a page . Cent.  xv (about
                        1442) ,  in a good Italic hand , on white
                    vellum. Doubtless written at  Florence . It was in the
                    collection (as we see from  T. James )
                    before  1600 , but does not occur in  Parker 's list.

                  Fol.  1r  has a very fine full
                        border of massive gold and colour, of characteristic Florentine work. Three
                        times in the border occurs a blue shield with a representation of a barrel
                        with a fire in it, set on an upright shaft upon a square base, and
                        approached by a ladder. This is thought by  George Williams, editor of the  Correspondence of Bishop Bekynton  (Rolls Series, I,
                            xxxiii)  to be the rebus of  Thomas
                            Bekynton  (Beacon-tun), Bishop of Bath and Wells. 
                    Flavio  Biondo  (the author of the volume before us)
                    was a correspondent of Bekynton's, and in a letter (I, p. 241) promises him a
                    gift, which is probably this book. The letter in question was written at  Florence  in  1442 .

                             The initial has a half-length figure of a man in upright
                                cylindrical red cap, and dark red robe, holding a book 
                         
                         This MS. contains the Third Decade of  Flavius
                                Blondus 's Historia ab inclinatione Romani imperii,

                         and proceeds to Lib. X of this Decade 
                         Then follow two books of a fourth Decade, of which the first is
                            identical with the xith book of Decas III in the Basel edition. The
                            second is inedited: an extract relating to a mission to  Abyssinia  is printed by G. Williams ( Correspondence of Bishop
                                Bekynton II , 227) 
                         The books begin as follows
