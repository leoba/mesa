                  Collation: 
                     The collation of the volume, at least of the earlier portion, is so
                        confused as to be unprofitable. The order of the leaves has been thoroughly
                        well ascertained by  Mr H. T. Riley  and is set
                        forth below . 
                 At the bottom of f.  1r  this inscription:  
                     Hinc (Hunc) librum cronicalem tam gestorum regum quam abbatum post mortem

                        Et licet diuerse materiei diuersa sunt propter defectus quaternorum non
                        consonancia studeat tamen lector flores mellifluos et coloribus amaricatos

                 On the flyleaf  (f.  ir ) 
                    is an account in pencil by  Mr Riley  of the contents
                    of the book:  
                     This volume contains three distinct Historical works (not five as  Nasmith  says) in addition to an
                        account of  Abbots de la Mare ,  Moote , and  Heyworth , and a Register
                        of the Benefactors of  St Albans  down to the early
                        part of the  15th century ,  183 - 264 , the leaves of the
                        latter being intermixed.   (A). The first of the Historical MSS. (A.D.
                             1377-1405 ) embraces  1 - 28 ,  43 ,  44 ,  31 ,  32 ,  71 ,  72 ,  101 - 104 ,  89 ,  90 ,  41 ,  42 ,  29 ,  30 ,  45 - 48 , being mutilated at the end.   The second
                        of the Historical MSS. (A.D.  1392-1406 ) is a continuation of
                        the  MS. in the Royal Library at the British
                            Museum 13 C IX (ff. 177-326)  and embraces pp.  49 - 70 ,  73 - 88 ,  91 - 100 ,  33 - 40 ,  105 - 136  of this
                        volume.   The third of the Historical MSS. (A.D.  1392-1422 )
                        begins at  137  and ends at  182 , being mutilated at the commencement. It is
                        the basis of  Walsingham 's text.   From the
                        Note at the foot of  1r  we may conclude that the leaves of the
                        three MSS. were thrown together in this confused state when they were still
                        the property of the  Abbey of St Albans .  H. T. R.    (C). The second work (other than
                        those mentioned above) in this volume is the  Liber de Benefactoribus Mon.
                                 S. Albani   (now published in the  Rolls Series,  Chron.
                                Mon. S. Albani  , in the same volume with  Trokelowe ) occupying  203 - 222 .   (B). The third
                        work in the volume seems to be a continuation of the  Gesta
                            Abbatum Mon. S. Albani  contained in the  Cotton MS. Claudius E IV . It is imperfect and has
                        been divided into three fragments in binding up this volume: the context
                        running  223 - 240 , two leaves having been cut out before  223 , and three leaves after  240 : it then goes back to  183 - 202 , and is then continued
                        at  241 - 264 ,
                        the last leaf being mutilated.

                         The next portion which appears in the MS. (though  Riley  in the note copied above describes it last in order)
                            is the continuation of the  Gesta Abbatum . The
                            true order of the pages, as noted above, is  223 - 240 ,  183 - 202 ,

                             There is one picture in this portion at  241  representing  Abbot John
