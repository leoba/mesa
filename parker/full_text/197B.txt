                    facsimiles there, and in  Westwood,  Anglo-Saxon and Irish MSS .    In  Gregory's Prolegomena, p. 995, it is no.
                        20: the number is given wrongly as 297 .   It is  no. 24 in Westcott's list in Smith's  Dictionary of the Bible , art. Vulgate . 

                 The view has often been expressed that
                    the  Cotton MS. Otho C. V  (of which only
                    burnt fragments remain) once formed a portion of this manuscript.  Tanner  supposed it to be, the Red Book of Eye (see my
                          Sources , p.
                        6 ).
