                     John Booth  was Fellow  1627-40 . He
                    bequeathed a printed book to the College and says  Masters  ( Lamb, p.
                        175 )  at the same time a MS. of his own was presented, whose
                        contents I could never learn.  Probably this is the volume in
                    question.
