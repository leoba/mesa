                 Two Old English fragments of a single leaf on the legendary
                    history of the Cross before Christ, from  Worcester .
                    Removed in  1952  from printed books donated to the College by  Matthew Parker , SP.4,  Tercia pars
                        Chronici Carionis  (Basle 1543) etc., and SP.260,  Fides Iesu et Iesuitarum  (Strasbourg, 1573).

                        (1957), p. 122 . Ker states that they are 'presumably part of a homily
                    for the Invention of the Cross' like that in MS  Bodley 343 .
