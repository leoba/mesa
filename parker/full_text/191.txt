                  Miss Bateson ( Eng. Hist. Rev.  1894, p. 699) 
                    has pointed out that this work is the Rule of Chrodegang of Metz as enlarged
                    after the Council of Aix-la-Chapelle in  817 .  Lord Selborne ( Ancient Facts and
                            Fictions concerning Tithes , edn 2, pp. 264-70)  had also
                    rightly identified the work, which previous writers had mistaken for the
                    Benedictine Rule.   A copy said to be by  Whelock 
                    is in  Harl. MS. 440 . It contains the
                    capitula complete (doubtless excerpted from the text, as they are in  Wanley, p. 130 ). Another (Latin only)
                    is in  Vitellius D. VII , much burnt. This
                    last was a volume of  Collectanea  of  Laurence Nowell , and this text is described by him as copied from a
                    book belonging to  Exeter Cathedral . On this account
                    the present MS. is identified (rightly, as it seems) with one of  Leofric 's gifts to  Exeter :
                    probably no. 21 in his list (Regula Canonicorum) but possibly no. 23 (Canon on
                    Leden). There was also a copy at  Christ Church,
                        Canterbury ,  Regula Canonicorum Anglice  (  Ancient Libraries , p. 51, no.
                        317 ).   The text is to be edited by  Professor Napier for the Early English Text
                        Society .
