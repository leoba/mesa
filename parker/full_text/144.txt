                 From  St Augustine's, Canterbury .
                    On f.  1*r  is:  Di(st) XI G ra  1 retro (possibly, as  Hessels  read, retus, for retrorsus, but I think the letter is a
                        rough o). elucidacio quarundam parcium cum A. liber  S.
                            Aug. Cant.     Not in the old catalogue: no. 1350 is
                         Liber de obstrusis sermonibus parcium 2 fo. omnes D. (blank) G.
                        (blank)  but the 2nd folio does not correspond.  

                 f.  1*v  blank except for scribbles. 


                 These are the contents of this volume, quite briefly
                    indicated. The whole was edited by  J. H.
                        Hessels , M.A., in 1890 with the greatest care and completeness: a
                    facsimile accompanies his edition. The text was first printed by  T. Wright in his Vocabularies , then
                    by  Wulcker in 1884 , and
                    again by  Professor Sweet,  Oldest English Texts  1885 . 


                  The ornamental initials which begin the divisions
                        of the glossary are deserving of careful attention. They are in the Celtic
                        manner, and often, but not always, surrounded with red dots. Their execution
                        is very good indeed. Both they and many smaller initials are filled in with
                        patches of yellow or dusky blue .  
                     There is one good outline initial on the leaves at the
                    end .
