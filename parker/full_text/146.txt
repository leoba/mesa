                 The origin of the two portions of the
                    book has been pointed out by  Henderson,
                        York Pontifical 1875, Surtees Society (Introd.), nos. iv and xiii . See
                    also  W. H. Frere, Alcuin Club Collections,
                        English Pontifical Services 1901 I p. 93 . He says  The Benedictional
                        seems to belong to  Winchester  and to the
                             xi th century: it is possible that some of the preceding
                        part of the Corpus is older.  But the  Winchester  portion is undoubtedly the oldest part of the book.  Liebermann Gesetze p. xxi calls it Ci
                        and uses it for Coronation oath, Ordeals, and Excommunication forms pp. 215,
                        401, 435 .  L. G. W. Legg,

                             another similar hand  appears, no title

                         On p.  327  a hand like that of  item  6
                            writes (Apoc. xxi. 3) 
                         In diebus illis uenit angelus et locutus est

                             Probably in the hand of p.  327

                         It is evident that the four leaves pp.
                                 323 - 330  were at one time meant to be
                            inserted after p.  280
