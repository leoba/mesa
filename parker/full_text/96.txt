                    The upper corners are gnawed off.

                        the cover) . 


                  Lieberman  dates it at about
                         1425 .

                        Chronica comparata est a M ro

                    volumine.    At top of f.  1r  in  Bale 's hand:  Chronicon  Joannis Bromton 
                        Abbatis Joreuallensis Cisterciensis instituti .   Lower down

                 The attribution of this Chronicle to
                         John Brompton  rests on the authority of this
                    manuscript: but the inscription quoted cannot be held to show that the Abbot of
                         Jervaulx  was the author: he merely procured the
                    book for his monastery.   
                     Twysden 's is the only edition of
                    the text.  Liebermann ( Gesetze  p. xix)  uses it for the Latin version
                    of the Anglo-Saxon Laws: his symbol for it is  Br .   On  Peter Osburne  see  Cooper's  Athenae
                            Cantabrigienses  II 125 .   In  Bale's  Index Scriptorum  (p.
                        185)  he appears as the owner of a copy of Brompton's Chronicle, which
                    must be our MS. The date of the Index is placed by the editors at
                         1549 - 1557 .  Osburne  died
                    in  1592 .   See  Hardy,  Materials  II 539 .
