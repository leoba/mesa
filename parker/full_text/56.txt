                 A transcript of the   Arundel  manuscript (now Royal 14 C. VII)  of the History
                    including the  Historia Anglorum  from  1067  to
                         1253 ; the latter portion of the  Chronica
                        Maiora  from  1254  to  1259 ; and the
                    continuation, from  1259  to  1273 . In  MS 348  is a second transcript of part of the  Historia Anglorum  


                 This account is taken for the most part
                    from  Sir F. Madden's description (Matt.
                        Paris  Hist. Anglorum , Rolls I p. lxix)

                             Hoc apographum fieri fecit  Parkerus  ex

                                minor desinit in anno  1250 , caetera desumuntur ex

                          In the initial letter D the arms of  Parker  are introduced , and in
                            order to make each of the first eight lines begin with an  e  several words have been altered 

                         
                             The shields, etc., which occur in the original MS. are neatly
                                copied in colour on the margins of the present volume 
                         

                         Between the prologue and the transcript of the Historia is
                            a copy of the genealogical tract contained in  MS 26  (Considerans prolixitatem), coming down
                            to the reign of  Henry III . Another copy,
                            continued to  Henry V , is in  MS 100  

                          At the beginning of the reign of  Henry III ,  Parker 's arms are again inserted , with the
                            date  1567  
                         At the end of  1253  is this note:
                                 Hucusque progreditur Historia Minor; quae sequuntur sunt ex
                                Historia Majore  Matthaei Parisiensis  
                         
                         At the beginning of  1254  is:  Ex libro
                                Arund. Com. 
                         
                         The portion from  1254  to  1273 
                            has been used for the press, as appears by  Parker 's references to his edition in the margins.
                            Throughout the transcript these have now been covered with paper 
                         One of them at the year  1167  reads:
                                 Omnes hae literae inseruntur in exemplari  domini Cecilii  
                         
                         This refers to the  MS. now Latin 6048 B
                                in the Bibliotheque Nationale : it belonged to  Sir W. Cecil , and had been lent by him to  Parker
