                         Parker  as the eighth volume of his collection of
                    Anglo-Saxon Homilies. 

                 This copy is mentioned in the  Camden Society edition of the  Ancren
                            Riwle  (by J. Morton, 1853, p. vi)  but is not used for the
                    constitution of the text: an extract given by  Wanley (p. 149)  is reprinted at p. xxiii.  
                    The most original text, in a different dialect, seems to be the imperfect copy
                    at  Gonville and Caius (no. 234) .   The
                    C. C. C. MS. has been transcribed for the Early English Text
                    Society; specimens
                    (from this transcript) are given in   Anglia  1907, p. 103 etc. by Dr Heuser . In the
                          Modern Language
                            Review  (July 1909) Professor A. S. Napier  deals with Dr
                    Heuser's article, and shows that certain prayers were copied from this MS. and
                    archaic forms designedly introduced into them, by  W.
                        L'isle . His copy is in the  Bodleian
