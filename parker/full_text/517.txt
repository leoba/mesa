                         xiv, xv . In a grievous state from damp. 

                  Collation:  Impracticable. The book had 26 quires of 12 leaves, at
                    least, but several at the beginning and at least one at the end are damaged or
                    lost. At the beginning the writing has suffered much from damp.

                 Sermones  Thomae Aquinatis  (old
                    list).   It contains questions on the Sentences.   The first part is not
                    usable.
