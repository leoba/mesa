                 Probably written at  Tours , but
                    with some ornament added in  England . The emphasis laid
                    on  Vincent  and  Benedict 
                     in the second Litany  points to an abbey dedicated to the
                    former saint. It is plain that the book was in  England 
                    in cent.  xi  when the drawing on f.  1v  was added. The
                    occurrence of the Gospel for the feast of  St Elphege 
                    confirms the tradition that the book was at  Canterbury . 

                 An inscription on f.  140v  of cent.
                         xvi  runs thus: Hoc psalterium laminis argenteis
                    deauratis et gemmis ornatum, quondam fuit .N. Cantuar. Archiepiscopi, tandem
                    venit in manus  Thomae Becket  quondam Cant.
                    archiepiscopi quod testatum est in veteri scripto.  

                 On f.  2r  of text is an erasure, apparently
                    beginning psalterium.

                         On f.  1r  is the end of the  pseudo-Augustinian  passage Canticum psalmorum animam decorat
                                ( CXXXI 142 ,  CXLII 46 ). It begins here

                         cor laetificat etc.

                             On f.  1v  a fine frame in colour with panels of
                                excellent interlaced work and some birds' heads at the angles.
                                Within it is a fine full-length figure in outline in the Anglo-Saxon
                                style of a bearded man with fillet about his head, holding a book.
                                The drapery is excellent 
                         

                         Below, the initials W. S., very small 

                         The text of the Psalter begins f.  2r :
                                 plain gold initial to Beatus. The words  Beatus vir  in red and green capitals  
                         
                             Initials to verses alternately in red and a peculiar green.
                                Titles of Psalms are in red rustic capitals 
                         

                         The first few Psalms have copious interlinear glosses in Latin, but
                            after about Ps. xii these become very scanty 

                         Ps. li  Quid gloriaris  has
                                 full-page frame with interlaced work (white on black) and
                                large initial with similar work. Green and yellow-brown are
                                conspicuous colours here  
                         Ps. ci  Domine exaudi  has also
                                 a full-page frame with panels of interlaced work. This is
                                specially interesting because the colours have to a large extent not
                                been put in, and the pattern remains in outline. Purple is the only
                                colour which has been added: part of the outline here is in
                                red  
                          Dixit dominus  has  a
                                larger initial than the rest, but it is quite a plain
                            one  
                         After Ps. cl:  in red capitals  
                         Alleluia. Expliciunt psalmi 
                         Psalmus ipsi Dauid
