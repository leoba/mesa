                    Volume I: 
                     The writing is very fine , and the book may have been, as
                         Bishop Stubbs  suggests, a
                    presentation copy to  Archbishop
                        Hubert .   Volume II: 
                     In a very good clear Roman hand  of cent.

                     Volume I:  From  Christ Church,
                        Canterbury . On  1r  is at top,  Annuales , and below,  Annales  stephani archiepiscopi  .  Stephen Langton  is meant. The book occurs as no. 1438 in the
                    principal catalogue ( 
                         Ancient Libraries  , p. 122 ) among Libri  Stephani Archiepiscopi .  
                     Volume II:  not Italian, but written, I believe, in the Low
                    Countries. I find no name or mark of owner. 

                 One of the vellum leaves which follow
                             ( 30v )  is part of a document of cent.
                         xvi .  Edmund (Bonner) Bp of
                        London  is mentioned.

                            Diceto  I xcix, and the collation of it in the same work vol. II p.
                        lxi etc.  which gives the whole contents. The text is a compilation of
