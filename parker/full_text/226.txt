                 Stephen Langton, De poenitentia sub persona Magdalenae 

                 Stephen Langton (?) De penitentia Magdalenae 

                  Vellum ,  
                         233 
                         170 
                      9.2 x 6.8 ,  ff. 112 +
                        4 ,  30 lines to a page . Cent.
                         xiii ,  apparently in the same hand as  MS 222 : the flyleaves belonging to it
                        are in that volume . 

                  Collation: 
                     3 flyleaves, I 8 -XV 8 , 1 flyleaf . 

                 The flyleaves are from a MS. of sermons (?) in double
                    columns. The name  
                         Savanarola 
                      is scribbled on the flyleaf; no doubt in consequence of some confusion with
                         MS 237 . 

                 Marginal references to authorities are given  in a hand of cent.
                             xiii  : noteworthy is one which occurs several
                    times,  philo in libro sapientie  as a ref. to the Wisdom of Solomon. 

                 The text is evidently the Liber de penitentia Magdalenae of
                    which the flyleaves are in  MS 222 . This
                    volume therefore is also from  Christ
                        Church, Canterbury . No title is given. 

                 The tract is ascribed by  Bale  and  Tanner  to  Simon Langton , but by  Balliol MS. 152 , by  Boston of Bury , and
                    also by  Bale , to  Stephen Langton .
