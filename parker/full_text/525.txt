                 Homilies. Johannes Aretinus, Aureum poenitentiale 
                 [Untitled] 
                  Paper with vellum flyleaf ,

                     ,  11.7 x 8.3 ,  ff.
                        cir. 300 , much damaged:  in double columns  and
                         in more than one hand . Cent.  xiv,
                        xv . 

                 The binding is practically gone. The book can hardly be
                    opened. 

                 
                     Too fragile to be foliated in its entirety. Partially imaged: front
                        exterior + first leaf recto foliated as a + back exterior - the boards do
                        not survive .
