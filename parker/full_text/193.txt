                 Is the book from a monastery or church
                    of St Sebastian? 
                 Lines are ruled with a dry point on the recto: a vertical
                    line down each side. 
                 An erasure of some length at top of f.  1r .
                    The inscription was in small capitals of cent.  xi , and
                    began  LIBER SC ... AM ... S . It extends across the top of the page and is
                    continued at the side, where are perhaps 2½ words  S ... S / M ... STS /
                        ... . I fear it is irrecoverable. 
                 The manuscript is the oldest complete copy of the Hexameron
                    of  Ambrose . It is thus described by  C. Schenkl in the Vienna edition of Ambrose 1896, I

                     A manuscript note in the College Library copy

                             Dr Traube 's opinion that this manuscript is
                        of cent.  viii-ix , and was written at  Corbie .  Professor W. M. Lindsay 
                        confirms this and adds that  it is written in the Corbie
                                 ab-type  of script . 
                 
                 On the margin of f.  148v 
                    are about 6 lines of writing running the length of the page: erased and
                    indecipherable by me. 
                 At top of f.  163r  is
                    scribbled ( ix-x ):  
                     Conspicitur sus.   Conspicit ursus. 
                 

                 There are many scribbles on the
                         final  page  (f.
                         170v ) , some with neumes, e.g.:   iesu saluator
                    seculi.   Sanctus sebas(tianus).   Secundum quod ipse dixit. Ego dormiui
                    et somnum cepi etc. 
                 
                     On the flyleaf   at the end (f.
                             iir )  are fragments of pencil sketches
                            ( xiii-xiv ), a tumbler, a beast's head etc. in very
                        good style.
