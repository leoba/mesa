                  The catchwords are enclosed
                        in rather elaborate ornaments .  
                  About f.  24r  the hand begins to get
                        larger and settles into a script which continues to the end .

                         198v ,  note by  Parker : hic desunt usque ad 7 h. quinti. This refers to  MS 182 . A later note:  imperfect. he wrot
                        to almost the end of  Edw. 4th .  

                 For the period  1333  to
                         1377 , this MS. has been used for the edition by  Dr F. Brie (E. E. T. S.) , the
                    introduction to which has not yet appeared. It was also used, as Mr  J. A. Herbert  tells me, by   Joshua Barnes , for his
                        history of Edward III .
