                    Psalterium in lingua et charectere armenica. 
                 It appears from  Parker 's correspondence (pp. 265, 6, 71) that in  1565 
                    he had sent a 'quayr of straynge carecters' (so the  MS. 114, p. 493 ) to  Bishop Davies
                        of St David's  to decipher. In a letter of  Davies ' collaborator  William Salesbury 
                        ( MS 114, p. 491 ) to  Parker  there is a postscript:  
                     προθυστερον. Yit to trouble your grace w th 
                        thys piece more τη̑ζ ὑστερολογίαζ. After that my Lord by cwmferryng thies
                        vnacquaynted χαρακτωρ namely in the wordes before tyme extracted cold fynd
                        no consonant agreament, as in իսիո for Sion (meruaylyng to se the same
                        lettre twyse therin) and cold not make of it neither Walsh Englysh Dutche
                        Hebrewe Greke nor Latin his L. gave ouer to bestowe any more tyme theron.
                        (And gave the matter to  Salesbury  Salesbury (see D. N. B.) had some reputation as a
                            philologist and was said to know nine languages.  to settle: which
                        he could not do.)    This letter shows (a) that the book in question
                    was Armenian, (b) that it had in it words  extracted before tyme,  by the
                    help of which  Davies  tried to read it. One of such
                    words was Sion. Now the Psalter before us has, as noted above, many proper names
                    transliterated in the margin, and among these Sion occurs several times. I have
                    no doubt therefore that our book is that which was sent to  Bishop Davies .   The identity of the person who succeeded in
                    deciphering the book is worth investigating. It has been thought, on the
                    strength of a fragmentary letter in  Trin. B. 14.
                        52 , that  W. Lambarde  the antiquary had
                    worked at Armenian. The evidence is as follows: on the first leaf of that
                    manuscript are six lines of Latin verse signed W. L. (or W. P.) (forte  Wilhelmus Lambarde ) says  Wanley .   Below this, in a bad
                         xvi th cent. hand, is the following (printed with
                    several mistakes in my  Catalogue I
                        460 : I have tried to correct the blunders here. See also  Wanley, p. 169 ;  Strype,  Parker I  533 ):  
                     Manye will Bragge of their knowledge and haveinge of Antiquities but the
                        writer of the verses above is the onlye man that ever I cold be acquainted
                        with for the readinge of this boke and other Antiquities, his Calender of
                        the Byble maye apere to your grace but I most humblye beseche you that
                            y e  paynfull workes by him gathered after
                        your grace hath perused might not be wraped vpp in obliuion how he hath
                        traveled in the Armenian tongue may apere ...    Strype  Parker  I
                            533 (II 508)  quotes the verses and the letter, and adds:  The
                            rest is wanting. The person that writ this I strongly conjecture to be
                                 Tho. Wotton Esq. , and the worshipful,
                            godly, and truly learned in antiquities and a correspondent and friend
                            of the Archbishop's.     The identification of the person here
                    alluded to with  W. Lambarde  depends on the
                    correctness of the interpretation of the initials W. L. (or P.).   The
                         Calender of the Byble  mentioned in the letter ought to serve as a
                    clue. There was a Calender of Scripture printed in 1575 ( Sayle,  Early English Books , no.
                            96 8  )
                    which is attributed to  William Patten  by  Ames .  Tanner  includes a Calendar of the Bible among  Lambarde 's works, but merely on the strength of the documents quoted
                    above, which he had read in  Strype .
                    Another piece of evidence seems to point strongly towards Patten as the person
                    here alluded to. In  Parker's Register ,
                         John Parker  adds to the entry of this Armenian
                    Psalter the following words:  8 o  perg. A
                        testimonie of Antiquities etc. cum alphabet' Armenico per Patten . Among
                    the printed books given by  Parker  to the College
                    there is a tract corresponding to this description, of which I will give
                    particulars here.        On the strength of this evidence I claim the position of the first
                    English student of Armenian for  William Patten .
                    Plainly the initials in the  Trinity
                        manuscript  should be read as W. P., not W. L.
