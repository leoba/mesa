                         xv and xii .  It is the second volume of  MS 3  and (with the exception of the
                        first quire) seems to be in the same hand . 

                  Collation:

                        canc. in 2nd half) XXII 8 -XXXV 8 . The old foliation
                        remains . 



                 The  Dover  press-mark has
                    disappeared but there is no doubt of the provenance. 
                 I think the artist who illuminated
                    no. 4 was not the illuminator of  MS 3 . It
                    also seems to me that the illuminator of no. 4 and  Eadwine , the artist of the  Canterbury
                        Psalter at Trinity College , have a good deal in common. It is
                    antecedently probable that this Bible was made at  Christ
                        Church Canterbury , of which  Dover Priory 
                    was a dependency.
