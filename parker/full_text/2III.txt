                     (now bound in three parts) ,  double columns of 42
                        lines . Cent.  xii ,  in a magnificent
                        round hand ,  and with splendid ornaments . 
                  Collation: 
                     a 2  (1 canc.) I 10  (wants 4 and 7: 8 is a double
                        leaf), II 8 -XLIV 8  XLV 6  (wants 5,
                        6) . 

                 The book comes from  Bury St Edmunds
                        Abbey . On the upper corner of f.  2r  (first leaf of
                    text) is a mark rather smaller than in most Bury books, but of the same kind: B.
                    1.   The press-mark shows that this was the first book in class B. The B here
                    stands for  Biblia .   Further, at f.
                         322r  the edge of the leaf has been mended with a patch of
                    vellum in  cent. xv  on which is sketched a crowned head (cut
                    off at the neck) and a scroll inscribed  hic, hic, hic .
                    This represents  St Edmund 's head, which called out
                         Here, here,  to those who were searching for it after the martyrdom.
                    It fixes the provenance in a very satisfactory way.   In the old catalogue
                        ( cent. xii, xiii ) of the Abbey books preserved in a  MS. at Pembroke College  and printed in my
                          Essays on the Abbey
                            of Bury , 1895, p. 23 , the second item is  Bibliotheca in
                        duo uolumina (!) : and in the   Gesta Sacristarum , Arnold,  Memorials of Bury St Edmunds Abbey  (Rolls Series II, p. 290) 
                    in the account of  Hervey  (sacrist under  Anselm  in  1121-1148 ) this passage occurs:  
                     Iste  Herveus  frater  Taleboti
                            prioris  omnes expensas inuenit fratri suo priori in scribenda
                        magna bibliotheca et manu  magistri Hugonis 
                        incomparabiliter fecit depingi. Qui cum non inueniret in partibus nostris
                        pelles uitulinas sibi accommodas, in  Scotiae 
                        partibus parchamenas comparauit.    This passage seems to refer
                    specially to the illuminating of the Bible in question. I interpret it thus:
                    that  Hervey  found the money for his brother the prior
                    to have a great Bible written, and had it painted after a matchless sort by the
                    hand of  Master Hugo . The latter not finding vellum to
                    suit him in our district procured parchment from  Ireland .   Clearly there cannot have been any difficulty in
                    getting good vellum to write upon in  England . But the
                    special vellum required by the painter was a superior and rarer article. Now it
                    will be found that in this Bible all or almost all of the paintings are done
                    upon separate pieces of vellum which have been pasted down on the leaves of the
                    book.   I have no hesitation therefore in identifying the volume before us
                    with a portion of the Bible of  Magister Hugo . It is
                    most interesting to have a work of this artist preserved. Like many workers of
                    his time, he exercised more than one craft. He is recorded to have made the
                    bronze doors of  St Edmund's Church , to have carved a
                    fine rood for it, and to have cast a great bell.
