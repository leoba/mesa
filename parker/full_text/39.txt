                 At top of f.  1r 
                    ( xv-xvi ) is the word or name  May . On f.
                         384v  near the bottom in old pencil:  I (or X) C. xii .
                    At top of f.  1r  an inscription has probably been cut off. I have
                    an impression from the character of the writing (coupled with the press-mark, if
                    press-mark it be, at the end) that the book is from  Norwich
                        Priory .

                         Without title: libri I - XV (II - XVII).  Note that
                                in the printed editions Liber I is the compiler's Preface to the
                                whole Speculum, which is not in this copy. Liber I of this MS.
                                therefore = Liber II of the print and so on. Further, books X and XI
                                of the print are here shortened (esp. book X) into one book, Liber
                                IX. Liber X of the MS. therefore = XII of the print and so on, XV of
                                the MS. = XVII of the print.
