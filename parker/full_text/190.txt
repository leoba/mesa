                    Volume I:  The

                     Volume II: 
                     The hand is at first large and black, and after a single change of
                        script (probably) a small and delicate hand appears (p.  320 )
                        and continues with a few interruptions to the end .  
                     Volume III: 
                     Mostly in a hand similar to that of no. 22 sqq.

                 The book is from  Exeter . At top
                    of p.  1r  ( xvi ) is: Ex ... us
                    (probably for  Exoniensis ).  

                 In large letters on the verso of the flyleaf  (p.
                             i ) : Penitencialis  Theodori  archi. epi. The word Theodori has been in part
                    re-written. 


                 This is identified by  Wanley  with the book presented by  Leofric  to the  Church of Exeter  and
                    entered in the list of his gifts as  Scrift boc on
                    Englisc . In  MS 265  certain passages
                    supplied from it are said to be from a  codex
                    Exoniensis .   A copy of this MS. made in  1656  by  John Retchford  for  Mr. Cornelius
                        Bee  is  MS. Harl. 438  ( Miss Bateson,  Engl.
                            Hist. Rev.  1895, p. 715 note ).   In the article just cited
                         Miss Bateson gives a most valuable
                        study of this MS. on pp. 715-720 , showing the many discrepancies
                    between the table of chapters and the text.   I have thought it well to
                    append a summary of her account, as follows:  
                     Wilkins  and  Thorpe  printed their version of the  Excerptiones Egberti  from the  Cotton MS. Nero A. 1 .  Johnson  translated them and compared them with
                    the collections in  MS 265 .  Lord Selborne in his  Ancient Facts
                            and Fictions about Tithes   compared these two latter MSS. in
                    further detail. The MS. 190 forms an interesting link between the two. It
                    appears to have escaped attention owing to the misleading nature of the table of contents.  
                     Thorpe  printed as far as the 43rd
                    (44th) chapter  de Reconciliatione .   No break here, p.
                    94; then follows  Item de reconc.  and a passage from a
                    Nicene Canon.   Two long passages not noted in the index:   a. Rubric.  In nomine Domini . Primo omnium admonemus omnes homines ut
                    super omnia ... percipere mereatur sempiternam. Amen.   b. Space for Rubric.
                         Ecclesia sponsa Christi est et omnium domina . Against
                    the spoilers of the church: cases of  Pompey  and  Alaric  quoted.   p. 97. cap. 45. Clerus grece, sors
                    latine (cf.  Nero A. 1, f. 127r ).   46
                    resembles  Thorpe's Excerpt §
                    161 .   45-50 are concerned with election and ordination of bishops and
                    priests.   47 resembles closely  MS 265 ,
                    pp. 4-7.   49 excerpts from the first Nicene Council: contains  Thorpe Excerpt 98, 99 .   50 from
                    the Council of Agde 544, cap. 35.   51 quotes  Beda 
                    on the history of the pallium.   p. 105. 52 resembles  Thorpe 44 : a passage from  Gregory  added.   53. Council of Chalcedon cap. 2, with  Thorpe 33 .   54. Quicunque
                    dignitatem gradus non custodierit, with quotations from O. T.   55 quotes
                    Popes  St Alexander  and  Felix .   p. 109. 56. From  Gregory  to
                         Johannes Defensor  ( P. L. LXXVII 1294 ).   57. Sunt quidam sancte dei
                    ecclesie inimici, complains that some deny force to the clerical oath: quotes
                         Pope Pelagius .   58. Gregorius ait. Scimus
                    itaque quia vita presulum nulli; breaks off.   Capp. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63
                    lost.   p. 111. Latter half of  Thorpe,
                        60 .  
                     Thorpe, 61-85 .   Three
                    sentences, beginning Si homo uexatus a diabolo, which resemble the genuine
                    Theodore, Lib. II x § 1, 2, 3; also in  MS
                        265 , p. 71.  
                     Thorpe, 86-97 .   Passage on
                    tithes, de jure sacerdotali; also in  MS 265 .  
                     Thorpe, 101-127 .   Rubrication
                    begins again at cap. 104,  Thorpe .   p. 124. Quotation from  Pope Leo 
                    to  Rusticus of Narbonne .   Excerpts 128-130, 134,
                    146 (called  Can. Bonan.  for  Roman. ), 135-140.   Then the break;
                    2 pages left blank and subsequently filled in; see above, p. 458, arts.
                    5-9.   p. 134-8. Excerpts 132, 133, 147-160.   p. 138. 1st Nicene council,
                    cap. 3, more fully than in excerpt 31.   Excerpt 32.   From this point
                    there is no further resemblance to the excerpts.   Passages with rubric  Alia . Multis autem declaratur exemplis (that clerics
                    should not bear arms).  De militia et victoria
                        christianorum  etc.   p. 139. On the captivity of the Jews, followed
                    by the  Alcuin  passages; see above.   Then the
                    nature of the contents changes.   Miss Bateson proceeds to show that the
                    index of the MS. is discrepant with the contents,  a discrepancy of much
                        interest, since the index tells us that what is missing is that mysterious
                        work  Capitula de sacerdotali jure Egcberti
                            archiepiscopi . After cap. 63 (64), on the analogy of  Nero A. 1  and  MS
                            265  we expect that titles applicable to the Capitulary in 21
                        chapters will follow, but this does not happen.  The list (of 25
                    chapters) begins with 1.  Item Canones Sanctorum  and ends
                    with 25.  Ut ab alterius episcopo nullus crisma
                    accipiat .   The index proceeds 26  De coniugio  and
                    here the contents of the MS. begin to answer the description of the index. This
                    title may well cover the excerpts 113-20.   The next, 27. 
                        Item de legitimo coniugio  = Exc. 121-125   28 = 126   29 =
                    127   30.  Leonis pape  (cf.  Hinschius,  Ps. Isidor , p.
                        615, cap. 4 ) is not in  Nero A.
                    1 .   31 = 128-9   32 = 130   33 = 146   34 = 134-140   35 =
                    132-3   Here again the index breaks down, making no note of Exec.
                    147-151.   36 = 152-3   No note is made of Exec. 154-160. The rest of the
                    titles in the index tally with those of the text.  
                     The meaning of these discrepancies, and especially the relation of capp. 1-25
                        to the title which alleges them to be of  Egbert 's
                        authorship, I cannot explain. But no discussion of the authorship of the
                        work  De Iure Sacerdotali  is complete without a
                        reference to this manuscript.  
                 There are three main portions of the book: the first consists of 19 quires (20
                    including the preliminary one) and is in Latin. It contains Nasmith's articles
                    1-18. The second contains nos. 19-29: the third the remainder.  
                 
                     James reproduces Nasmith's contents-list, which he printed from the
                        eleventh-century contents-list of the manuscript; however this does not
                        correspond exactly to the manuscript's actual contents. Therefore we have
                        not included Nasmith's material in Volume I of this description. To view the
                        Nasmith material for this section, follow the link to the .pdf reproduction
                        of the James catalogue.
