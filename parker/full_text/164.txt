                             The pictures (lacunae excepted) exactly coincide with a set in

                                    5)  of Flemish (Dutch) work, very finely coloured. The
                                arrangement in the copy before us is peculiar. The two types are on
                                the Left page one above the other; the antitype on Right page with
                                four busts of prophets bearing scrolls:    
                         

                         The text on the Left page is a brief explanation of the type, beginning:

                         On the Right page are usually three verses, e.g. for Epiphany

                                 Christus adoratur aurum thus mirra letatur. 
                                 Hoc tipice gentem notat ad christum uenientem,
