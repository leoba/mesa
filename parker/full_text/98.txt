                         Until we reach  Eneas ,  there are
                                only medallions inscribed with names , after that the text
                            begins

                         Some periods are copiously treated, others very briefly 
                         
                             The Welsh princes occupy the central line: the English kings

                         At  Henry III  the pedigree of the  Conte Mareschalle  begins 
                         
                             The original hand I think ended with the shield of

                          The subsequent medallions are added by another
                            hand : they contain the names of

                             remarks: Final loci will be added after filming and will be based on
                                the digi file names. Despite the difficulty, CCC will also provide
                                measurements of the chronicle rolls but again will wait for
                                filming.
