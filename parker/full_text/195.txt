                 Two flyleaves of vellum  (f.  iiv , p.
                             491 )  pasted over with paper are  in a
                        fine hand of cent.  xiii early   and have portions of a
                    French gloss on parts of Ps. xvi, xvii (Latin) with Latin text in red. Ps. xvii
                    (xviii) begins thus:  Diligam te, etc. ... liberator meus ciuers uiaut dire O
                        tu sire ie tamerai tu es force tu es mon firmament tu es mon defendement et
                        tu es mon deliureres. Li titles de cist saumes en latin est a  dauid  por les paroles que il chaunta en ce saume a
                        nostre signor.  

                 At top of the first paper leaf  (p.  1 )  in red:
                         Ταλβωτος Σαλβυρινος  and a note in red on the contents. On verso:
                         Nomina regum quorum res gestas presens historia describit.  On a
                    subsequent leaf  (p.  4a )  a list of years with
                    reference to pages and on the last preliminary leaf  (p.
                             24 )  a note on the author from  Bale . 

                 I do not find any notice of this MS. in  Riley's edition   . I suspect the sixteenth century portions were
                    supplied by  Parker  from the  College of Arms MS. Arundel VII , which he certainly
                    used for his edition printed in  1574 .   Sir F. Madden in the
                    Preface to  Matthew Paris, Historia
                        Anglorum I lxvi , says definitely that this MS. was used by Parker for
                    his edition and that the fact escaped Mr Riley's notice. He also records that
                    this MS. is in the same hand as the  Colbert  copy
                    (formerly  Sir W. Cecil 's) of Matthew Paris, now  Bibl. Nationale Lat. 6048B . Parker had noted
                    this fact in the Paris MS.
