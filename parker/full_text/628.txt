                    decoration  Paris , of the mid-thirteenth century, about
                         1240 . 

                 Presented to the College by the  Rev.
                        William Favell (Old Member, matriculated 1922)  of Hove, Sussex, in
                         April 1976 , as recorded in a pencil note on f.
                         1r . A letter is also kept with the manuscript giving further
                    information. He had inherited it from the estate of his cousin,  Richard Vernon Favell , sheriff of Cornwall, who died in
                         1936 . The Psalter appeared in the Sotheby sale  14th July
                        1937 , lot 616, but seems to have been withdrawn and given to a member
                    of the family. 

                  Illuminated historiated and ornamental initials
                        and line endings. The style of all these can be compared with Parisian
                        illumination of the mid thirteenth century as noted by C. de Hamel in   The Parker
                                Chronicle , 3, 2007 , p. 13. The figure style can be
                        compared with the later  Bibles moralis√©es  of the
                        1240s .

                         Saints characteristic of  Paris  are  Denis  among the martyrs,  Germanus  and  Marcellus  among the
                            confessors, and  Genevieve  among the virgins.
                            The inclusion of  Dominic  among the confessors
                            suggests a date after  1234  when he was canonised
