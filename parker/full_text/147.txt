                 There are marginal notes on the prologue by  Geoffrey Blithe, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield
                            ( 1503-33 ) , adverse to  Wycliffe . See especially ff.  14v ,  15r :
                    on the latter page is a  Parker ian note:  This is
                        the hand of notes of  Galfride Blith  sum-time
                        Busshop of Lich. and Couentry as before.  
                 In  Foxe Acts and Monuments IV  186
                    articles are cited which were produced against  Richard
                        Hun  ( 1514 ):   Dr Hed  did now
                        also after his death collect certaine others out of the prologue of his
                        English Bible remaining then in the Bishop's hands  ( Fitzjames of London ). Many or all of the passages in the Prologue to
                    which these Articles refer are marked or annotated in our MS. by  Blithe . It has been suggested that this may be  Hun 's copy (cf.  Church
                        Quarterly Review, 1901, p. 292 ).
