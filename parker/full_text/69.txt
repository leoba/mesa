                 Gregory the Great, Homiliae XL in euangelia 

                 Gregorii Homiliae 

                  Vellum ,  
                         300 
                         215 
                      12 x 8.7 ,  ff.
                        83 ,  double columns of 31 and 36 lines . Cent.
                         viii-ix  ( Bradshaw )
                         in a fine Hiberno-Saxon hand ,  with initials
                        of Celtic type . The last leaf has been stuck to the cover and is
                    torn. 

                  Collation: 
                     1 12?  (wants 1, 2), 2 8  (wants 1?),
                            3 8 -10 8 , 11 (two) . 

                  2 fo.: 
                     Reuocando . 

                  The initials are of rather
                        rough execution. A peculiar feature is that every page is bordered on R. and
                        L. and between the columns with lines of red dots, in groups of
                        three . 
                  The hand varies in closeness but may very probably
                        be the same throughout . 

                 
                     ff. i + 1-83 + ii . 

                 
                     Latin.
