                            pages in facsimile, and a most elaborate and ingenious Introduction, in
                            which Mr Rule contends that this Missal is copied from one given by
                                 Gregory  to  Augustine . Mr Rule has presented to the College a manuscript
                            volume written by himself entitled  A
                                Study of MS. C.C.C.C. 270 , which is preserved in the
                            manuscript class
