                 Note that in   Historical MSS. Reports I  65 , there is a notice
                    of a paper roll given by  Th. Whincop  in
                         1690 , and written by  Andrew Middleton,
                        Bencher of the Middle Temple , in  1527 , going from the
                    Creation to  1066  A.D.: now among the College Muniments. This is
                    wrongly described in  Stanley's
                        Catalogue  as Misc. 23.
