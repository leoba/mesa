                 Possibly from  Norwich , see below:
                    it may have been the property of  Bale . 

                 The contents show an interest in  East Anglian  matters. The look of the book, style of
                    script and ornament incline me to suggest  Norwich  as
                    its home. There is a  xv th cent. note on the same page of
                    payments. The MS. is mentioned as no. 17 in the  Rolls edition .  Parker 
                    and his secretaries have made many marginal notes.
