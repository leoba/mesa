                         The Bibliotheca Exterior is first treated. The records of donations go
                            down to  1660 . The only manuscript mentioned is the Koran
                            given by  Mr Hitchcock  ( no. 249 ) 

                         After 14 blank leaves we have the Bibliotheca Interior 

                         A few manuscripts  extra Catologum  are mentioned: see further on

                         The Register of Plate begins with a resolution of the College ( 8
                                June 1648 ) that such a Register should be kept 
                         Then follow the arms of each donor very carefully drawn and a notice of
                            his gift. These run from about  1590  to
                             1743
