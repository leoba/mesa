                            Libraries , p. 210, no. 224 .   The giver died in
                         1367  and was buried in the  Abbey
                        Church . 

                 One flyleaf at each end  (ff.
                             iiir - iiiv , ff.
                             ivr - ivv )  is a waste leaf of a
                    similar copy of the Apocalypse, written by the same scribe, and with blanks left
                    for pictures. That at the beginning has the Latin text:  Et dabo duobus
                        testibus meis etc. , that at the end:  Et cum aperuisset sigillum
                        sextum etc.  A similar phenomenon occurs in an Apocalypse at  Trinity College (B. 10. 6) . 
                  The book is copiously illustrated. The pictures
                        extend across the page and are in frames of gold and colour with foliage at
                        the corners. The grounds are of very various colours, usually a chequer of
                        some kind in blue or salmon colour with network of vermilion or blue lines
                        over it and various patterns: one form unfamiliar to me is a ground of
                        squares each containing a face roughly done, e.g. f.  10r  and
                        often elsewhere. Portions of gold ground also occur. The colouring is bright
                        and light: the drawing not of the finest kind. The subjects of the pictures
                        will be quite shortly indicated . There are coincidences of
                    treatment with  Brit. Mus. Add. 18633  which
                    contains the same metrical version: but the two books are not alike.

                                part of it. The forms of the churches are interestingly
