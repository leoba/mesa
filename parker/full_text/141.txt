                 The shelf-catalogue occupies ff.  1r - 81v . The Index ff.  82r - 110v . 
                 The volume was admirably edited by  Miss Bateson, Cambridge 1898 , at the University
                    Press. 


                  There are very handsome initials, principally in
                        pen-work, to the divisions of the Catalogue: three elaborate ones are on f.
                             1r . On the margin of this has been a picture .  
                     A roughly painted diaper ground remains, but an oblong patch, probably
                        of finer vellum, which must have had a figure (either a suppliant or a dead
                        man in a coffin), is gone .   Above this an early copper
                    engraving has been pasted on the page and torn off all except a small
                    corner. 
                 Below the painted ground is the motto:  Viuentes in carne orate pro mortuis
                        quia moriemini .
