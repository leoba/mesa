                             The name of the author or possessor of this book was formerly
                                written in golden letters on a vacant page at the end, but thro'
                                time or accident is now partly defaced; the only remaining words are
                                these,   Johannes Monke  ...  Michael ...  
                         
                         On f.  142v  at top in gold are the names  
                              Iohannes Monke  ...  Michael   but I see no trace of erasure. They have
                            been meant to stand over a picture which was never drawn
