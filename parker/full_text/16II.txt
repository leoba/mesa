                 This is the second part of the Chronica Maiora extending
                    from  1189  to  1253  inclusive. The greater portion is in
                         a hand which is erroneously said by Sir  F.
                            Madden  to be that of  Matthew
                        Paris  . Two others also appear. The first of these, a fine
                    black angular character, appears in ff.  1r  -  3v ,
                         8r  -  10v ,  13r  -  32r  col. 2,
                         46v  col. 1 -  50r 
                    col. 2. The second writes  32r  col. 2 -  33v  col. 2,  55r  -
                         61v  col. 2, and also re-writes several
                    passages over erasures, e.g. on ff.  157r ,  197r . The   Paris  hand 
                    writes  11r  -  12v ,
                         33v  col. 2 -  46r 
                    col. 2,  50v  -  54v ,
                         61v  col. 2 -  111v ,  112v  -  281v . A fourth hand writes most of f.  112r .   The original numbering omits f.  77r .  
                    Leaves are lost as follows: three after f.  3v 
                        ( 1190-1192 )   one after  103v 
                        ( 1237 )   one after  116v 
                        ( 1238 )   one after  232v 
                    ( 1250 ).   The missing portions (except that after  116v ) have been supplied by  Parker , chiefly from the text of  Nero
                        D. v . 


                 This volume appears to have been in
                    the hands of  Robert Talbot  prebendary of  Norwich  ( 1547 - 1558 ) who has
                    written a note on f.  245r . It afterwards belonged
                    to Sir  Henry Sidney , K.G., from whom  Parker  borrowed it.
