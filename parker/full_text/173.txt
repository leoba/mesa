                 Volume I: It was in the Library of  Christ Church, Canterbury , no. 311 in  Prior
                        Eastry 's Catalogue (  Ancient Libraries , pp. xxvi, 509 ). The first
                    leaf with press-mark etc. has disappeared since Parker's time The first remaining page is numbered 3 by  Parker . . It appears to have been written at  Winchester  down to the year  1001 , and thereafter at
                         Christ Church, Canterbury .  Professor Earle  suggested that it was transferred from Winchester to
                    Canterbury when the monks at the latter place were endeavouring to repair the
                    losses in their library caused by the fire of  1067  ( Plummer, p. xxv note ). Another
                    possibility ( 
                         New Pal. Soc. 
                     ) is that  Ælfheah, bishop of Winchester , may
                    have brought it with him when he became archbishop in  1006 .   At
                    the Dissolution the volume came into the hands of  Dr
                        Nicholas Wotton the first Dean of Canterbury , who gave it to Parker.

                 The contents of the first volume are briefly these:  
                    Chronicle, ff.  1r - 32r .   Latin Acts of  Lanfranc , f.
                     32r - 32v .   Laws, ff.
                         33r - 52v .   Lists of proper bishops etc. ff.
                         53r - 55v  (f.  56r ,
                         56v  blank.) 

                 A  xiiith cent.  scribble on the 2nd leaf
                    of the Chronicle, another on f.  55v , and two others on ff.  26r  and  27v  of the
                    Sedulius, seem to me to be all in one hand. If so, the two portions have long
                    been bound together 

                 
                     ff. i-ii + 1-83 + iii-iv .

                                27 lines .  Both hands are of Celtic aspect. The
                                first is much rounder and more legible than the
                            second

                         (followed by diacon in minuscule) 
                         The first three letters appear to have been written over some others,
                            two of which appear to be IN. The letters in DE S
                                (with a tall minuscule s)  seem perhaps to be altered from
                            DEI. I have some suspicion that an inscription in capitals IN DEI NOMINE
                            has been partly erased and adapted to FRIÐESTAN. Dr G. F. Browne, Bishop
                            of Bristol, has suggested that this name may be an early signature of
                                 Frithestan afterwards ( 909 ) Bishop
                                of Winchester
