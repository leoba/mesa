                 It seems to have been collected and partly copied by  Pierre Assailly ,  examinateur  at
                    the Châtelet (but not in  G.
                        Dupont-Ferrier,  Gallia Regia , IV (1954), pp.
                        336-40 , list of  examinateurs  at the Châtelet),
                    and he takes an active part in this capacity in at least one of the cases.
                      Probably written in  Paris  in  1480 .
